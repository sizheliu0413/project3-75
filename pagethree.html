<p> I remember when I was in middle school, everyone has their own "website" that comes from a common software called "QQ", and people usually put their journals, photos, etc. Also, they could customize the home page. As techonology rapidly advancing, most people don't use and post things there anymore even it still exist. For this project, I kind of restore the style of that website which is neat and clean and also insert the same thing that I liked to put in that web page during that time, which is all about my favorite singer, JJ Lin.</p>
<p>The homepage, I used border to contain the video that I took from his concert, and I created the navigation bar, which are what we have in that "website". The position of photos from the image gallery is also similar as what I had before. When you click one of the picture, it will give you an original version. The background video on ther second page shows a dark environment. This is from my memory: when I was still a middle school student, my patrents did not allow me to use computer, so almost every night, I slinkingly went to the study from my bedroom, I couldn't turn on the light and could not make any sound otherwise my parents would be realized that I went use computer. So I had this dark environment and the sound of air in the second page. </p>
